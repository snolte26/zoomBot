# zoomBot
A bot in the making to join my zoom classes

Currently in order to enter my zoom classes, I need to login through 
my schools canvas page and navigate to the zoom class. Right now, the
bot isnt able to differenciate which class I need to be in based on day
or time. 
I plan to put that in when next semester rolls around

The bot asks which class I need to be in, then logs me into canvas, and 
navigates to the correct zoom class
